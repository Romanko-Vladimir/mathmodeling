In these programs, the problem of approximating functions of one variable by a Fourier series is solved. We define a real function f(x) and build its graph. On the same graph, we build an approximation of this function by a Fourier series.

It can be seen that for a sufficiently large number of terms in the Fourier series, the function approximates well. This is true for all but the most extreme points (-pi and pi).

The first program approximates functions in a Fourier series in real form. The second program approximates functions in a Fourier series in a complex form. The first program is much faster than the second because it calculates the integrals numerically. The second program does this symbolically using the SymPy module.
